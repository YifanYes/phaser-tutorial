# Phaser Tutorial

This is a simple platform web game made with Phaser 3.

It's hosted on an Express.js web server.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run nodemon
```

The project will be available on `http://localhost:3000/`.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.18. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
